""" Creates the conditional frequency distribution

    @param sentences a list of sentences from the training data
    @param n the length of an n-gram
    @return a mapping of context (unique substrings of the first n-1 characters) to endings (last character) and their frequencies
      a dictionary of mapping between the first n - 1 characters of an ngram and
      a list of tuples of the ending characters

  for each sentence in list of sentences:
        get n-grams using above method
        group by first n-1 characters (context)
        for each unique context, create a map of last character counts
          e.g., if you have the ngrams "chair" and "chain":
                the context would be "chai" and the last character counts would be "r -> 1" and "n -> 1"
        add the [ context -> last character counts ] mapping to your ultimate CFD (also a map)
          e.g., your CFD  would have lots of entries that look like: 
                "chai" -> ["r" -> 1, "n -> 1]
                as an key-value pair.
