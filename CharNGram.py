        group by first n-1 characters (context)
        for each unique context, create a map of last character counts
          e.g., if you have the ngrams "chair" and "chain":
                the context would be "chai" and the last character counts would be "r -> 1" and "n -> 1"
        add the [ context -> last character counts ] mapping to your ultimate CFD (also a map)
          e.g., your CFD  would have lots of entries that look like: 
                "chai" -> ["r" -> 1, "n -> 1]
                as an key-value pair.
        

      (NOTE: you don't have to structure your conditional frequency distribution in this particular way; I just found it more intuitive.
      If it doesn't make sense I can go over it on gchat, or feel free to come up with your own implementation if another way makes more sense!)
